# Metro Routing and Scheduling System

## Overview
This project aims to enhance metro transportation efficiency by integrating advanced pathfinding algorithms with a scheduling system. It optimizes commuter travel routes and minimizes waiting times at stations, leading to improved operational efficiency and reduced travel time.

## Features
- **Shortest Path Finder:** Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the shortest paths from a source station to all other stations.
- **Targeted Route Finder:** Implements A* Algorithm for finding the shortest path between a specific source and destination.
- **Line Change Optimization:** Identifies optimal interchange stations for seamless multi-line journeys.
- **Travel Time & Distance Calculation:** Computes estimated travel time and distance.
- **Efficient Scheduler:** Generates metro train arrival and departure schedules to avoid congestion and ensure smooth operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Algorithm
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Scheduling Techniques:** Constraint Programming
- **Graph Processing:** Metro network representation using nodes and edges
